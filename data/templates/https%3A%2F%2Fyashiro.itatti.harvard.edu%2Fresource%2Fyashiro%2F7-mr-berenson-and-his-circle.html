                            Unable to bear the gloom of London&rsquo;s foggy
                            autumn, I took off for Italy. This no doubt reflects
                            my constitutional disposition as one born in Japan,
                            the land of sunshine; but at the same time, I had
                            wanted from the start to do some research on
                            Renaissance painting in Italy, and in the end I was
                            drawn to Florence, the mecca for such things.<br /><br />There
                            was one more reason for this: Bernard Berenson, the
                            scholar whom I respected the most, lived in Italy.
                            It is a matter of fact that the history of Italian
                            painting up to the modern era has been rewritten
                            with the appearance of Mr. Berenson on the scene,
                            and when it comes to books written before Berenson
                            it is by no means an overstatement to say
                            that&mdash;with the exception of Vasari, on the
                            older end of the spectrum, and Burckhardt, more
                            recently&mdash;any other work has been largely
                            rendered obsolete. So it was my hope that, if I were
                            to go to Florence, I would receive guidance on
                            art-historical matters from Mr. Berenson, and then
                            see the paintings themselves closely with my own
                            eyes, make my own judgments, and conduct my own
                            research. Perhaps it was because I was the only
                            Asian among Mr. Berenson&rsquo;s disciples and his
                            extraordinarily broad field of interest also
                            included Eastern art, but I was treated with
                            affection by my teacher. In the more than forty
                            years since, I have called innumerable times upon my
                            teacher&rsquo;s villa, I Tatti, on the outskirts of
                            Florence, sometimes lodging for longer periods of
                            time there. Nowadays the students of Mr. Berenson
                            are scattered throughout Europe and America. There
                            are a great many of them, in various countries and
                            locales, who are now generally senior members in
                            their countries&rsquo; fields of art history. They
                            treat me with respect, as one of their midst.

                            Those days&mdash;the 1920s, in other
                            words&mdash;were a time when Mr. Berenson&rsquo;s
                            various research endeavors were bearing fruit, and
                            the old inaccuracies in Italian art history were
                            being corrected bit by bit. There were many figures
                            in the history of painting who until then had not
                            been widely studied, such as Masolino da Panicale,
                            Domenico Veneziano, Andrea del Castagno, Piero della
                            Francesca, Paolo Uccello, and so forth&mdash;one
                            could simply say the Florentine School of the
                            Quattrocento. An outline of the artistic
                            achievements of these masters, in whom there had
                            been little interest until that time, was gradually
                            becoming better established, and one new discovery
                            after another became the topic of an academic
                            article to be published. It was the most remarkable
                            period of development for modern research into the
                            history of fine art. Those of us young students in
                            Berenson&rsquo;s circle also found this completely
                            exhilarating, and were in the heights of competition
                            for the discovery of new materials and the
                            presentation of new interpretations.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I also pursued some research as a part of that
                            group, but before long I felt the flames of youthful
                            ambition and turned my attention to a bigger
                            name&mdash;Sandro Botticelli. Botticelli possessed a
                            remarkably unique genius, even among the diverse
                            community of painters in Florence, and he matched my
                            tastes perfectly. It is almost mysterious, if I may
                            say so myself, how even today when I go to the
                            Uffizi Gallery and stand before true masterpieces
                            like <em>La Primavera</em> or
                            <em>The Birth of Venus</em> I feel, just like long
                            ago, as if assailed by a kind of strange allure.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The supple bodies of Venus and the other goddesses,
                            their long limbs, their slender and supple fingers,
                            their long golden hair fluttering in the wind, the
                            well-defined, curved forms created by Botticelli,
                            maintain a realistic authenticity, but also seem to
                            deviate from this somewhat, taking on a mysterious
                            slender beauty not found elsewhere. One almost feels
                            its delicate rhythm, as it begins to entwine around
                            one&rsquo;s heart. Even when he is simply depicting
                            wild flowers scattered in lush grass, one can sense
                            in each flower&rsquo;s depths a concealed spirit,
                            and the flowers speaking to each other&mdash;not
                            unlike, for example, the sentiment expressed in
                            &ldquo;The Sensitive Plant&rdquo; by Shelley, that
                            English poet who loved Italy and ultimately drowned
                            in the Italian sea: this is the mysterious,
                            polytheistic sort of mutual sensitivity that
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s art imparts to me. That being
                            said, with the exception of older literary critics
                            like Walter Pater, one finds virtually no reference
                            in recent books on Botticelli to this kind of
                            spiritual core in Botticelli&rsquo;s art, which is
                            what I find most interesting about it, nor to the
                            form of expression, endowed with a kind of strange
                            enchanting power, that this guides through instinct
                            and brings to fruition. This, actually, seems to be
                            due to the fact that, as a reaction to the
                            excessively poetic interpretations of the early
                            Walter Pater and others in the nineteenth century,
                            there emerged a scientific approach to scholarship
                            in the twentieth century that focused on the
                            so-called critique of formal aspects, which took
                            poetic interpretation and interpretations based on
                            sentiment to be nothing more than a string of
                            so-called literary associations. Going even further,
                            this new approach gave birth to the sort of tendency
                            that largely denies that lyricism should be
                            considered as part of artistic content. Even still,
                            the truth is that, in art, there is much that
                            abundantly contains poetic feeling or sentiment, and
                            this is the way it ought to be; there is no reason
                            to think that in art an approach is invalid simply
                            because of its inclusion of poetic interpretation.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            That being said, even in the case of academic
                            interests there are fads and there are reactions to
                            those fads. As a reaction to the overwhelming
                            popularity of the Pater style of poetic literariness
                            in art criticism in the nineteenth century, from the
                            twentieth century onward, the dominant milieu came
                            to be one wherein interpretation based on poetic
                            sentiment was largely rejected as an approach, even
                            in the case of an artist like Botticelli, in whose
                            work anyone can see the richness of poetic
                            sentiment. Although this strikes me as strange
                            indeed, it was the truth.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Of particular note is Herbert Horne, the Botticelli
                            expert who passed away not long before I arrived in
                            Florence, and whose foundational research on
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s historical circle, above all, was
                            the greatest achievement in that field. Using old
                            documents written during Botticelli&rsquo;s
                            lifetime, Horne found Botticelli&rsquo;s own art
                            being praised with the term <em>aria virile</em>, or
                            &ldquo;masculine style&rdquo;; using this as his
                            basis, Horne put forth the new theory that the
                            Pater-esque exclusive appraisal of sentimental
                            beauty through such figures as Venus, or through
                            sweet maidenly angels, or, alternatively, through
                            the dreamy facial expression of the Virgin Mary,
                            surrounded by angels, was not legitimate. This new
                            theory, due to the fact that it was based on the new
                            discovery of unexpected historical documents, was
                            taken very seriously among scholars. When one
                            studies Botticelli, one does, admittedly, find that,
                            in his youth, he was an avid student of the austere
                            technique of Pollaiuolo, known as an expert in
                            realism, for the realistic painting of human
                            figures, and that, as a result, there is admittedly
                            reason in his art to believe that it would have been
                            praised while he was alive as <em>aria virile</em>.
                            And Botticelli was by no means a painter of a frail
                            feminine decadence, almost as if there were nothing
                            to him but sentimental beauty, as was the way Pater,
                            Rossetti, and others in that circle of sensitive
                            late-nineteenth-century English poets and writers
                            understood him. At its foundation,
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s art without a doubt possesses the
                            strength of a Pollaiuolo-esque masculine beauty, and
                            it is precisely because of this that Botticelli was
                            successful in uniform composition on a large scale
                            with no internal discrepancies, and that he fully
                            possessed of the capacity to rank among the greatest
                            masters of his day. Even if that is the case,
                            however, one should by no means lose sight of the
                            other side of Botticelli, the fact that he possessed
                            in uncommon measure a sentimental nature stirred by
                            an indescribably delicate sensitivity and a feminine
                            attunement to detail. Indeed, that is not all: while
                            duly acknowledging the presence of
                            <em>aria virile</em>&mdash;and one would have to
                            give the fresco <em>Saint Augustine</em> of the
                            church of Ognissanti as an example of a masterpiece
                            in that vein&mdash;I, among others, nonetheless
                            cannot help but think that it is inappropriate to
                            find the artistically defining trait of all of
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s work in anything but
                            the tenor of his sentimental beauty. However, art
                            historians, no matter the country, have a tendency
                            to show excessive reverence to research based on the
                            study of archival documents; if there is a new
                            discovery of something written in an old text, art
                            historians will pounce on it and wave it about. This
                            is the same for scholars East and West, past and
                            present. When I went to Florence, the views on
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s art appeared to be almost
                            completely aligned with this new discovery of
                            <em>aria virile</em> by Herbert Horne. Especially
                            since this was a historical criticism made during
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s own lifetime, the world of
                            Italian art history was even more prepared to accept
                            this, a criticism of Botticelli&rsquo;s art from
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s era, as if it were indubitable
                            fact.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Now, this rare news of contemporary criticism from
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s own lifetime was of exceeding
                            interest, and furthermore one cannot of course deny
                            its substantial archival value. Nonetheless, it is
                            not a given that contemporary views always hit the
                            mark. This is the same for the fine arts and for
                            music. Starting with the famous case of Schubert, we
                            are aware of many striking examples&mdash;almost too
                            many. Since such is the case, there is little need,
                            when considered objectively, to use the discovery of
                            a single document, which shows that
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s art was praised as
                            <em>aria virile</em> while he was alive, as if it
                            were the undeniable critical criterion for all of
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s art. In this way, when I arrived
                            in Florence I felt exceedingly dissatisfied with
                            this sort of hermeneutic for Botticelli&rsquo;s art,
                            which seemed to dominate the scholarly field, and I
                            wanted to get closer to the various aspects of his
                            art, using my own way of looking at it, such that I
                            could believe in these aspects as correct, and
                            thereby try to greatly clarify them. Such were the
                            exceedingly brazen ambitions, possible only because
                            I was still young, that flared up within me.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            At that time Mr. Berenson held a view of Botticelli
                            somewhat different from that of the scholarly
                            community of Florence, and I thought to myself what
                            a good thing it was that I came to study with him.
                            To put this another way, despite the fact that Mr.
                            Berenson was the person who originally established
                            the new school of thought in art history that
                            specialized in the scientific analysis of formal
                            elements, at the same time he possessed an extremely
                            keen sense of artistic intuition, and in the case of
                            Botticelli, as well, he profoundly felt the presence
                            of a kind of poetic sentiment that could even be
                            called strange. Since he had no other appropriate
                            way to express it, he called this aspect of
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s work &ldquo;Eastern.&rdquo;
                            According to Mr. Berenson&rsquo;s way of thinking,
                            in Botticelli&rsquo;s art one senses a spiritual
                            element akin to the poetic or perhaps mystical
                            properties of Eastern art, and which one does not
                            usually find in Western art. Accordingly, he pointed
                            out, one can on occasion unexpectedly encounter in
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s painting style special
                            characteristics, such as flowing line drawings, that
                            are similar to what one finds in Eastern painting
                            and that are not usually seen in Western painting.
                            Although I, a youth from the East, had suddenly come
                            to make myself the student of Mr. Berenson, who
                            thought about Botticelli in this way, it is not
                            necessarily the case that I have inherited his
                            &ldquo;Eastern theory&rdquo; and so forth; the art
                            of Botticelli captivated me in an entirely
                            spontaneous manner, and, furthermore, I began to
                            conduct research and form my own interpretations in
                            entirely my own style. As a result, from my
                            teacher&rsquo;s perspective there was probably also
                            the fact that his past words now seemed to have a
                            certain air of prognostication about them, and thus
                            he took me in as a kind of unusual guinea pig and
                            treated me with affection. I was, however, perhaps
                            the sort of student who does not listen to the words
                            of his teacher, and Mr. Berenson, in his wisdom,
                            never tried to teach by molding me into a mirror
                            image of himself, and let me do as I please. And for
                            that, above all, I was thankful, as one who, by
                            nature, tends to not pay much attention to what
                            others have to say when it comes to art history.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The fact that Mr. Berenson referred to artists like
                            Botticelli, and the Sienese School that preceded
                            him, as &ldquo;Eastern&rdquo; has actually nowadays
                            become all too famous, and some Western scholars
                            have been too receptive to what this suggests. Later
                            on figures emerged on the scene who pushed this idea
                            even further by attempting to prove that Chinese
                            painting had a direct influence on Botticelli and
                            the Sienese School&mdash;the French scholar
                            [Gustave] Soulier is one such example. Since this
                            was the actual state of things, I did not really
                            agree on the topic of Mr. Berenson&rsquo;s calling
                            the unique nature of Italian art from the figures of
                            the Sienese school through Botticelli
                            &ldquo;Eastern,&rdquo; on the grounds that, even if
                            it were a clever way of saying things and rich in
                            implications, it was also a way of saying things
                            that went too far and was extremely prone to
                            inviting misunderstanding. This is to say nothing of
                            the fact that there was no historical evidence that
                            suggested any such relationship between China or the
                            Far East and Italy during that period, and that
                            thereby would lead one to this imaginative theory
                            about the direct influence of Chinese art on the
                            formation of the style of the Sienese School and
                            Botticelli&mdash;a theory that, in those days, had
                            started to see its advocacy grow somewhat. If
                            anything, it seems as though we see a certain amount
                            of influence from the miniatures of the Near East.
                            Even still, I ultimately think that this matter can
                            be amply explained mainly as the spontaneous
                            emergence of an artistic phenomenon brought on by
                            the confluence of various circumstances of the day,
                            such as a certain amount of resemblance between
                            Italian painting of the Quattrocento and Eastern
                            painting in terms of watercolor technique, or in
                            other words the use of <em>tempera a secco</em>, and
                            the mystical disposition and religious tendencies of
                            Botticelli himself, for example. Since this set of
                            issues is so complex, I felt the need to organize my
                            thoughts on the matter, in later years giving a talk
                            in Italian at the University of Rome entitled
                            &ldquo;The &lsquo;Oriental&rsquo; Character in
                            Italian Tre- and Quattrocento Paintings,&rdquo; as
                            well as publishing an&nbsp;<a
                              href="https://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/resource/yashiro:oriental-character"
                              >English version</a
                            >
                            of that talk as an article in the academic journal
                            <em>East and West</em> of Rome. I would like to ask
                            those with an interest to take a further look there.
                            At any rate, I felt that there was something in
                            Botticelli that resonated with me in a very
                            interesting way, and setting aside the question of
                            whether it is appropriate to call that feeling
                            &ldquo;Eastern&rdquo; or not, I somehow made up my
                            mind, and gradually came to feel as if I had been
                            given as my academic mission to one day try to
                            understand this issue in my own terms.

                            Although the sentiment above is, to be sure, nothing
                            other than my own conceited ambition resulting from
                            a youthful impetuosity, the crowd of talented,
                            energetic scholars who had come from throughout
                            Europe and America to gather as part of Mr.
                            Berenson&rsquo;s circle each burned with their own
                            individual ambitions. Each went on afterward to
                            publish their own tomes and to become nowadays
                            senior experts in their respective countries,
                            important figures in their fields of the fine arts
                            and scholarship. In this regard, I cannot but thank
                            the heavens to be blessed with the good fortune of
                            being suddenly tossed into this vigorous group of
                            fellow researchers with Mr. Berenson at their
                            center, having made my way from the East without any
                            such intent, and of being suddenly compelled to
                            harbor similar ambitions, whereby I was able to
                            accomplish a fair amount in my field. And I cannot
                            at the same time fail to remember with gratitude the
                            natural influence of Mr. Berenson that stemmed from
                            the greatness of his person. He spontaneously
                            brought out this spirit among his students.

                            This period&mdash;the period when I started living
                            in Florence and was granted the privilege of going
                            out to Mr. Berenson&rsquo;s villa on the outskirts
                            of Florence once a week to use the research
                            facilities and the wonderful art library
                            there&mdash;was truly an era that bustled with
                            activity. This also applies to the decades before
                            and after&mdash;that is, the first twenty or thirty
                            years of the twentieth century, when the traditional
                            history of Italian painting was almost entirely
                            rewritten: various new discoveries followed one
                            after the other, the mistakes of old ways of
                            thinking were corrected, and new research and new
                            materials were published in rapid succession. In
                            Rome there were the endeavors of Professor
                            <a

                            Berenson possessed his splendid, unique facilities
                            for research, and in Germany there was the scholar

                            breakthroughs. It was in such a pivotal period as
                            this that I was in Florence, the center of such
                            research, and furthermore I was able to spend much
                            of my time around Mr. Berenson, whom I believed to
                            be the foremost leader in these changes. And,
                            precisely because things were at a peak of
                            exceptional intensity in terms of both time and
                            place, the fact that I was able to join naturally
                            the group of young scholars gathered there was not
                            only of great benefit to my own research topics, but
                            also meant that I was granted the opportunity of
                            encounters that would have been impossible normally,
                            giving me many interesting experiences that stand
                            out in my life as a scholar.

                            I will try to recall one such experience here, but
                            in order to do so it will be necessary to briefly
                            explain the condition of Renaissance art studies in
                            those days. For specialists in the field of Italian
                            art history back then, one of the most intriguing
                            issues for anyone was the attention suddenly given
                            in the academic community to Domenico Veneziano, a
                            painter of the Florentine School who had until then
                            not been counted among the first rank of artists.
                            Domenico&rsquo;s traditional biography holds that he
                            was a prodigy with remarkable promise as a painter,
                            but that he was murdered by his fellow painter
                            Andrea del Castagno, who was envious of his talent.
                            However, after an investigation into archival
                            documents it came to light that Domenico Veneziano,
                            who was supposed to have been murdered young,
                            actually had lived longer than his alleged murderer,
                            Andrea del Castagno, and we also learned the
                            intriguing reason why such a mistaken legend came to
                            be in the first place. Andrea del
                            Castagno&mdash;who, legend had it, killed Domenico
                            out of envy of his talent&mdash;was, like Domenico,
                            a truly exceptional portrait painter. The grave,
                            pointed power of his realism was of such a strict
                            severity that it one could say it was
                            relentless&mdash;<em>cruel</em>, in other words.
                            They say that those painted by him sensed an almost
                            terrible power, a drawing near to the brink of
                            absolute veracity. One can to a certain extent
                            imagine this from his frescoes and so forth that
                            still exist in Florence today. During this period,
                            political strife was extremely fierce in Renaissance
                            Florence, and as a result traitors of the city of
                            Florence were frequently put to death in a violent
                            fashion: the criminal would have a rope tied around
                            his neck, and be thrown from a window high up in the
                            city hall, so that he would be hanged as a lesson
                            for all of the citizens to see. And as the days
                            passed the corpse began to rot, until a painter was
                            ordered to depict the figure of that hanged criminal
                            in a large portrait, which was hung from the window
                            in place of the corpse as a continuation of that
                            lesson. When the traitor was still at large, a
                            painter was made to paint a portrait of the criminal
                            hung upside down with his feet bound with rope,
                            which would then similarly be hung from a window of
                            the city hall while they waited for his arrest,
                            until the criminal was caught and similarly
                            sentenced. Now, it was precisely painters like
                            Andrea del Castagno who became known as the masters
                            of this sort of unusual portrait painting by
                            endowing their work with the utmost power and
                            veracity. Put another way, perhaps it was because he
                            was always being made to paint portraits of hanged
                            traitors with the goal of creating, to the maximum
                            extent possible, a sense of deep hatred toward the
                            criminals in the people of the city that his art
                            developed in the direction of a realism that was
                            brutal and cruel, almost lurid. In this manner, they
                            carried out in the Renaissance a method of execution
                            so lurid that it is difficult for us to imagine
                            today; the people of the city would go to observe
                            the sight without any qualms to satisfy their
                            curiosity, and when it came to painters, they would
                            often take advantage of the spectacle to make
                            sketches of it, seeing it as a very convenient
                            opportunity for studies in the accurate rendering of
                            the human anatomy and similar such research. This is
                            something we can easily agree upon by virtue of the
                            fact that even Leonardo da Vinci left a notebook,
                            which still exists today, of sketches done in pen of
                            corpses hanging with a rope around their neck. And
                            Andrea del Castagno, whom I am in the process of
                            introducing here as the foremost expert in the
                            depiction of these criminals condemned to death,
                            also left behind extremely accurate line drawings of
                            those hanged for their crimes. The deft and
                            unfeeling nature of the depiction&mdash;precisely
                            because of its unfeeling pursuit of objective
                            representation&mdash;weighs upon the viewer&rsquo;s
                            heart with such intensity that the drawings become
                            all the more uncomfortable to look at. Now, seeing
                            as how the people of Florence have a fondness for
                            talk and gossip regardless, before one knew it the
                            cruelty of the paintings became the cruelty of the
                            painter, and, by virtue of the fact that he had made
                            his name as a painter through the creation of these
                            sorts of incredibly gruesome portraits of executed
                            criminals, it came to be said about Andrea del
                            Castagno that anyone who can paint such terrible
                            pictures must himself be a terrible person.
                            Furthermore, it seems that this somehow or other
                            gave birth to a legend and concordant belief to the
                            effect that he was envious of the fact that Domenico
                            Veneziano, his contemporary, was such a prodigy and
                            that, spurred on by his intense feelings of envy, he
                            murdered his friend Domenico. It seems that such an
                            interpretation had been proposed by someone in the
                            Renaissance scholarly community not long before I
                            arrived in Florence. Regardless of whether this
                            hypothesis is correct or not, and even if it
                            warrants critique, the fact remains that the truth
                            of the matter&mdash;that the alleged murder victim
                            Domenico Veneziano lived longer than the alleged
                            murderer Andrea del Castagno&mdash;was discovered
                            through archival research into the painter&rsquo;s
                            death registers or some other such document, and was
                            even furnished with this kind of interesting,
                            imaginative explanation. Due to this, during the
                            period when I settled in Florence and joined Mr.
                            Berenson&rsquo;s research circle, Mr. Berenson as
                            well as the young, ambitious researchers who had
                            gathered around him all began to pay great attention
                            to these two painters of the Quattrocento, Domenico
                            Veneziano and Andrea del Castagno, who had until
                            then had not been thought of as prominent figures
                            and whose works were not well known. Accordingly,
                            there was a spirit of mutual competition in the air,
                            a vying for new discoveries to be made for both
                            figures.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The above should give a sense of the state of
                            affairs for the field of research on Renaissance
                            painting history during the period I spent in
                            Florence, based on my own personal experience. Now,
                            I would like to relate a remarkable occurrence from
                            this period in my life in the fine arts. Since in
                            those days I had already begun to delve into
                            research on Botticelli, it was difficult for me to
                            direct too much of my zeal to the issue of Domenico
                            Veneziano and Andrea del Castagno. To be sure, I
                            took a great interest in this, as it was one of the
                            important topics studied by my colleagues, and thus
                            I possessed a general knowledge of these two
                            painters. And this likewise meant that I was well
                            informed of the succession of new discoveries
                            regarding these painters. One year during this
                            period, I was off to the Fitzwilliam Museum of
                            Cambridge University in England to conduct research
                            on materials pertaining to Botticelli they had
                            there. One day, while
                            <a
                              href="https://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/resource/?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fyashiro.itatti.harvard.edu%2Fresource%2Fyashiro%2Fperson%2Fsydney_cockerell"
                              >Sydney Cockerell</a
                            >, the director of the museum, and I were talking
                            about something or other in the museum&rsquo;s
                            gallery, a member of the museum staff passed close
                            by us holding a small painting. Glancing at it, I
                            saw it to be a small painting of the Annunciation,
                            with exceptionally bright colors&mdash;an unusually
                            beautiful painting. I looked it over, and, thinking
                            to myself that this is without a doubt a work of the
                            Florentine School of the Quattrocento, and that
                            paintings from the period with such bright and
                            beautiful colors are rare indeed, I asked the museum
                            director, with whom I had been speaking at the time,
                            &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; He responded
                            off-handedly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
                            Ghirlandaio.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;There is no way
                            that could be&mdash;let me take a look,&rdquo; and,
                            calling the person carrying it to a halt, I took a
                            good look at it; and intuition told me that it was
                            painted by Domenico Veneziano. Domenico was a
                            painter who used bright colors to an unusual degree
                            for the Florentine School of that period, something
                            which I had for some time thought to perhaps be the
                            result of his Venetian origins, as the name
                            &ldquo;Veneziano&rdquo; suggests. At any rate, as I
                            looked closely at the painting I noticed that there
                            was an old, small tag with &ldquo;Domenico&rdquo;
                            written on it stuck to the frame. And then I
                            understood. At the name &ldquo;Domenico&rdquo;
                            everyone in those days thought of Domenico
                            Ghirlandaio of the Florentine School, the most
                            famous painter with that name; it was common sense.
                            I immediately realized that, for the longest time at
                            this museum, this painting had been assumed to be a
                            Ghirlandaio. At that point, I began to feel very
                            triumphant and proclaimed, &ldquo;This is the work
                            of Domenico Veneziano. Little has been made of him
                            until now, but currently he is the hottest topic in
                            research on the history of Renaissance painting.
                            Since this represents a completely new discovery of
                            one of his works, the day will come when this museum
                            will be happy indeed to be the owner of this.&rdquo;
                            Seeing as how a young newcomer from the East had
                            begun to make such brazen pronouncements out of the
                            blue, it is true that Mr. Cockerell, whom I had met
                            for the first time that day, had a bewildered,
                            nonplussed look on his face; but at any rate, this
                            kind old grandfather of a director thanked me
                            politely, and I felt overjoyed to have made such an
                            unexpected catch. I exchanged business cards with
                            the director and went home.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            After that something like two or three years passed
                            before I went again to England and visited
                            Cambridge&rsquo;s Fitzwilliam Museum. Before calling
                            on the director, I took a look at the gallery. I
                            thereupon found that Domenico Veneziano&rsquo;s
                            small painting of the Annunciation, which I
                            discovered on my previous visit, was now prominently
                            on display, and was labeled, too, as Domenico
                            Veneziano, just as I had proclaimed to the director.
                            This pleased me greatly; and as I gazed at the work
                            I suddenly noticed that a small newspaper clipping
                            had been affixed to the wall next to the painting.
                            Wondering what this was, I approached it to take a
                            closer look. It was a clipping from a British
                            newspaper, and contained the following sentence:
                            &ldquo;This picture was discovered in the
                            Fitzwilliam Museum by Mr. Yukio Yashiro, a scholar
                            of the history of Italian painting.&rdquo;<sup

                                >1</a
                              ></sup
                            >&nbsp;And I recall that the clipping included the
                            date of discovery. I felt extremely honored, and
                            when I asked the director about it he told me an
                            interesting story. As he confessed to me,
                            &ldquo;Back then I had just met you, and when I was
                            told all of a sudden that that was a piece by
                            Domenico Veneziano&mdash;to be honest, since I
                            don&rsquo;t keep up with the cutting-edge research
                            in Italy I didn&rsquo;t know much about Domenico
                            Veneziano, and I only half-believed it. What&rsquo;s
                            more, since it came from a young man from the East
                            such as yourself, I was all the more unsure as to
                            whether I ought to believe what you said or not.
                            Then a little while after that, a renowned scholar
                            of Italian painting from the University of Rome
                            visited (author&rsquo;s note: I have refrained from
                            giving his name here), and so we began to pull out
                            various Renaissance paintings from storage for him
                            to look at. Since that painting was among them, we
                            showed it to him. And then the professor looked very
                            pleased and said, &lsquo;This is a real find!&rsquo;
                            And he pointed out exactly what you had told me that
                            day. Well, that surprised me, and I told the
                            professor about how once you had stopped a staff
                            member who was carrying the small
                            painting&mdash;which had been traditionally
                            appraised at our museum as a Ghirlandaio&mdash;and,
                            glancing it over, said to me that the traditional
                            appraisal was mistaken, and that there was no doubt
                            that this was the work of Domenico Veneziano, who
                            had recently started to be well-regarded as an
                            important painter in Italy. And I also told him that
                            you were a young Japanese scholar. This same
                            professor, however, afterward presented the find as
                            if it were his own new discovery in a research
                            journal.<sup

                            them write that in the newspaper.&rdquo; I was then
                            deeply struck by Mr. Cockerell&rsquo;s kindness, and
                            furthermore thought to myself how his way of dealing
                            with the situation was indeed befitting the image of
                            a true English gentleman who holds justice in high
                            esteem. I admired him deeply for it, and thanked him
                            from the bottom of my heart.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This little personal episode, when viewed from
                            various angles, illustrates the zeitgeist of what we
                            may call the age of new discoveries in the history
                            of Renaissance painting in those days, and I cannot
                            help but think that it is deeply meaningful by
                            implication. Because it was truly an age filled with
                            that sort of competition for new discoveries,
                            scholars would put their effort into fishing around
                            various places for the discovery of something new
                            and into rushing to publish what they found. It was
                            like we were completely engrossed in racing to the
                            front of the pack. Since I happened to be working in
                            Florence under the auspices of Mr. Berenson, a
                            leading figure, and was a part of the group of young
                            researchers who had gathered around him, and since
                            news in one form or another about all kinds of new
                            materials and new discoveries would quickly reach
                            Mr. Berenson&rsquo;s villa, I had relatively early
                            access to the latest news and images pertaining to
                            all kinds of new discoveries in the field of the
                            history of Italian painting. As a result, I was able
                            to look at an unknown work by Domenico Veneziano at
                            the university museum in Cambridge and see through
                            its mistaken attribution at a glance. At any rate,
                            it will now be necessary for me to give a few more
                            details about this Domenico Veneziano here. At the
                            Uffizi Gallery in Florence, there is a large
                            altarpiece from the church of Santa Lucia de&rsquo;
                            Magnoli, which depicts the Virgin Mary surrounded by
                            various saints. I remembered that painting
                            well&mdash;especially its dazzling colors. Based on
                            that, as I have already explained, at the
                            Fitzwilliam Museum I was quickly able to determine
                            from its use of color that the small Annunciation
                            there was the work of Domenico Veneziano. And I also
                            knew that the predella, which would have been
                            originally displayed together with it, was missing
                            from the
                            <em>Santa Lucia de&rsquo; Magnoli Altarpiece</em> in
                            the Uffizi Gallery. The predella is a series of
                            oblong paintings below the main altarpiece that
                            depicts in miniature form various stories associated
                            with the figures in the main painting. Researchers
                            had for a while been searching with a general sense
                            of what to look for, thinking that this predella had
                            likely been split apart and was sure to be somewhere
                            in piecemeal form. It is customary for the middle of
                            the predella of an altarpiece that has the Virgin
                            Mary at its center to depict the Annunciation, that
                            is, the event that marks the beginning of
                            Mary&rsquo;s transformation into the Virgin Mother.
                            Thus, when I discovered the small
                            <em>Annunciation</em> at Cambridge, I was more or
                            less able to conclude at once that this was none
                            other than the all-important central piece of the
                            missing predella of the
                            <em>Santa Lucia de&rsquo; Magnoli Altarpiece</em> in
                            Florence.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            At this point, the story turns into a confession of
                            the depths of my own stupidity. Why did I not ask
                            Mr. Cockerell, with whom I had just been talking, to
                            let me take a photograph of the painting of the
                            Annunciation the first time I was at the museum in
                            Cambridge, when I was confident that it was the work
                            of Domenico Veneziano? And why did I not then
                            proceed to show the photograph to Mr. Berenson
                            immediately after returning to Florence, and rapidly
                            write it up in a paper and publish my findings? I
                            belatedly kick myself for being so careless. That
                            was how fierce the competition for new discoveries
                            and the race to the fore was in those days. What is
                            more, because issues pertaining to Domenico
                            Veneziano were, as I have already written, the focus
                            of academic attention those days, Mr. Berenson
                            praised me greatly when I told him about the matter;
                            it would have been as though I received the art
                            historian&rsquo;s Medal of Honor, so to speak, and
                            there is no doubt that I would have been able to
                            hold my head high indeed among my research
                            colleagues. But I was not yet used to such
                            competition over new findings, and did not realize
                            that one would have to act so immediately; what a
                            great fool I was to just let my discovery sit like
                            that. Even a prominent figure in the field like the
                            professor at the University of Rome apparently felt
                            the need to publish a discovery like that
                            immediately after seeing it, despite the fact that
                            the museum director at Cambridge had told him that
                            this was a discovery made by a scholar from the East
                            named Yashiro; and what is more, this professor
                            already knew me, and had helped me in matters
                            pertaining to Botticelli. I found this a little
                            strange, and although as a rule I make a point not
                            to engage in pessimistic speculation, perhaps all
                            bets are naturally off when the new discovery at
                            hand is one of exceeding interest to one&rsquo;s own
                            field of expertise, and thus this professor
                            published it in a great hurry as his own discovery.
                            From this one should be able to imagine the extent
                            in those days to which Domenico Veneziano was the
                            target of the scholarly gaze, and accordingly the
                            extent to which scholars were head over heels in a
                            mad dash to discover something new. If I had
                            immediately published the discovery of that little
                            <em>Annunciation</em> as my own, then, precisely
                            because it was a topic that was receiving attention,
                            I would have been recognized as an expert in
                            Renaissance painting several years before my
                            publications and books on Botticelli; and precisely
                            because of this, there is no doubt that things would
                            have been <em>much</em> more convenient in terms of
                            research. In this regard, I feel a certain amount of
                            regret for what I did.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            After that, the competition to discover the smaller
                            paintings of the predella of Domenico
                            Veneziano&rsquo;s
                            <em>Santa Lucia de&rsquo; Magnoli Altarpiece</em> in
                            the Uffizi Gallery began in earnest among scholars
                            from various countries in Europe, and I recall that
                            among them Mr. Berenson and the aforementioned
                            professor from the University of Rome had the most
                            respective discoveries in number. When I think of
                            how the smaller paintings of the predella must be
                            almost entirely recovered by now, I feel a little
                            burst of pride knowing that my own discovery, the
                            <em>Annunciation</em>, was the most important of
                            these and that it comprised the central portion of
                            the predella, even if I was careless in neglecting
                            to claim that discovery as my own.

                            apparteneva senza alcun dubbio a Domenico Veneziano.
