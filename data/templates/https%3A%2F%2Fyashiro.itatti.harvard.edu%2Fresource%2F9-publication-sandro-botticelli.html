                          <p>
                            Right when my Botticelli research had begun to take
                            off in this way while I was studying abroad in
                            Europe, the Great Kantō Earthquake of the twelfth
                            year of Taishō [1923] hit in Japan. Due to the fact
                            that my hometown, Yokohama, was one of the
                            hardest-hit areas, my father died while he was out,
                            our house was completely lost in a fire, and the
                            only thing spared was the life of my mother, who was
                            at home at the time. At that time I was in
                            Switzerland, seeing as it was summer, but, being an
                            only son, I decided to return home in haste when I
                            heard the news. I thought to myself that once I
                            returned to Japan under such circumstances, it
                            seemed unlikely that I would be able to come abroad
                            again for a while. Thus, I left Italy for London,
                            taking leave of my teachers and friends in Italy; in
                            addition, I took my leave of my British friends who
                            had helped me in various ways. I also showed them
                            for the first time my Botticelli research that I had
                            been working on up to that point in its entirety,
                            and as my farewell I told them, &ldquo;This is the
                            sort of thing I was working on until now, but since
                            we lost everything in the earthquake, my father
                            died, and my mother is the only one left, I have no
                            other choice&mdash;I will be returning home in
                            haste.&rdquo;
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            For whatever reason, my friends in London thereupon
                            gave high praise to the Botticelli-related work I
                            had done, and repeatedly advised me to reconsider,
                            saying, &ldquo;Yashiro, even if you hastily go back
                            to Japan now, it won&rsquo;t bring your father back
                            to life. If you leave this work unfinished and go
                            back to Japan, you&rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to
                            finish it there, since you won&rsquo;t have easy
                            access to the materials you need for this kind of
                            work in Japan. And who knows when another peculiar
                            fellow intent on doing this sort of work like
                            yourself will next emerge from the East. What do you
                            say, Yashiro, to remaining here a bit longer,
                            finishing what you started, and then going
                            home?&rdquo;
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            When it was put that way I naturally agreed, and so
                            I made up my mind to ultimately apologize to my
                            mother in my far-off hometown and remain in Europe
                            until my work was done. I made the decision with the
                            intent to get the permission of my mother and the
                            relatives who had kindly taken her in and were
                            looking after her, and to oblige the enthusiastic
                            recommendation of my friends. During that period,
                            while thinking
                            <em>forgive me, mother, forgive me</em>, deep down I
                            made a decision, resolute in the face of sadness, to
                            bring a splendid finish to my work such that it
                            would stand as an apology to my deceased father and
                            my waiting mother, and to no matter what show it to
                            them finished. And during that period my friends in
                            England discussed publication with the Medici
                            Society, the London publishers of the world-famous
                            color artwork reproductions the &ldquo;Medici
                            Prints&rdquo; as well as specialized books on the
                            fine arts, and they even negotiated for me a
                            contract for the monthly advance payment of
                            royalties until the completion of my manuscript. I
                            no longer had to worry about the expenses of
                            remaining abroad; they had seen to it that all I had
                            to do was simply immerse myself in the task of
                            completing my manuscript. I was moved to tears by
                            the kindness of my friends.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In the subsequent year and a half until I completed
                            the manuscript in its entirety and delivered it to
                            the Medici Society, I immersed myself in my work
                            with an utter franticness, as if I were literally
                            fighting with my back against the wall. Namely, in
                            great haste I went back to Florence from London and
                            started to work on compiling what I had done in
                            terms of research until that point; I finally
                            started to write my English-language manuscript in
                            the beginning of February of the following year, and
                            tentatively completed a first draft of my tome in
                            May. Even Florence became downright hot from around
                            that time onward, so I first hid myself away in the
                            Apennine Mountains, up from the city of Modena in
                            the central part of Italy; and then when the heat
                            was at its worst I went to Switzerland and secluded
                            myself in a lonely cottage inn in a place called
                            Riffelalp, near a glacier in the Alps. I carefully
                            looked over and rewrote my manuscript there until
                            the beginning of autumn. Then I rushed to London
                            and, together with the Medici Society&rsquo;s
                            editor-in-chief
                            <a

                              >Harry Laurence</a
                            >, concerned myself with scrupulously correcting the
                            English of my manuscript.

                            This editor-in-chief Laurence was quite an admirable
                            individual. In his youth he once published a
                            complete, deluxe edition of Botticelli&rsquo;s
                            famous large book of sketches for Dante&rsquo;s
                            <a

                              >Divine Comedy</a
                            >, which is held by the Berlin State Museums,
                            together with the famous German scholar of sketches,
                            Lippmann. Not only was he himself a great Botticelli
                            enthusiast by nature, but, what is more, due to the
                            fact that he was at that time the responsible party
                            who had decided to put out this major publication,
                            three large volumes on Botticelli written by a
                            completely no-name Asian such as myself, he, for
                            one, took it to be impermissible to have a single
                            fault anywhere in my book, and with the utmost
                            thoroughness concerned himself with conscientiously
                            correcting my prose. And furthermore, what amounted
                            to his way of correcting prose was truly unusual.
                            Actually, unusual does not even begin to describe
                            it. In truth, he himself corrected virtually none of
                            my English prose. It goes without saying that, had
                            he rapidly corrected my English in an ordinary
                            fashion, like the British or Americans normally do
                            in this sort of situation, then he would have been
                            able to promptly finish the corrections with no
                            trouble at all. He, however, was resolute in
                            refraining from that sort of method of correcting.
                            Namely, as Laurence would say,
                            &ldquo;Yashiro&rsquo;s&rdquo; prose has a
                            personality and a charm that is unique to Yashiro.
                            If he himself were to correct it, then it would
                            lapse into the ordinary prose of Laurence, an
                            Englishman, and cease to be Yashiro&rsquo;s
                            warm-blooded prose. And as a result, both its
                            special characteristics and its charm as
                            &ldquo;Yashiro&rsquo;s&rdquo; would fade. He was of
                            the fundamental mindset that, no matter what, the
                            meaning of this publication would be lost if it did
                            not clearly preserve &ldquo;Yashiro&rsquo;s&rdquo;
                            prose itself, with its individuality and special
                            characteristics. In other words, Laurence resolutely
                            insisted on working under the assumption that
                            &ldquo;the prose belies the person,&rdquo; to use a
                            phrase that has gained currency recently in Japan.
                            What is more, due to the fact that it would in no
                            way be permissible to have even minor deficiencies
                            in the prose of my book, being a publication of the
                            Medici Society, which prided itself on its high
                            quality, he carefully read my manuscript with me
                            letter by letter, phrase by phrase, and if there
                            were places that stood out to him&mdash;that felt
                            even a little off, or that did not sit
                            right&mdash;he would unsparingly point out each one.
                            And he would listen again carefully to my intended
                            meaning, and then diligently explain to me what was
                            wrong about the particular sentence, and then have
                            me correct it myself, asking me, &ldquo;Well,
                            Yashiro, how do we fix it?&rdquo; He patiently
                            repeated this again and again, and positively would
                            not stop until we had reached a point where he felt
                            that it would do. Indeed, in my entire life I have
                            never once gone through something else that tough,
                            before or since. Since the revisions dragged on so
                            unsuccessfully with no end in sight, I would grow
                            thoroughly discouraged, or alternately I would take
                            offense&mdash;but, even still, he was resolute in
                            not stopping. And there were also often places
                            where, no matter what, I could not compromise.
                            Although it was agonizing indeed, I myself was truly
                            moved by his utmost determination to go to these
                            lengths and turn my prose into good English, while
                            making sure its special characteristics as the prose
                            of a foreigner from the East were retained; and I
                            grit my teeth, and continued to persevere. When I
                            fell into particularly low spirits, in the evening
                            he would take me to the [National] Liberal
                            Club&mdash;a club associated with the Liberal Party,
                            in other words&mdash;of which he was a member, and
                            treat me to a quiet, delicious meal. I grew
                            accustomed to the lifestyle of the English club, and
                            it was because I was constantly being taken to this
                            sort of authentic English club and thus grew
                            familiar with them that I came to think it would it
                            would be a good thing if Japan, too, had real, truly
                            good clubs&mdash;places, in other words, where one
                            can relax in quiet without being bothered by others,
                            or, put another way, that are more than just places
                            to play around. And when this editor-in-chief
                            Laurence himself grew too worn out, he would say
                            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to the countryside to play
                            golf&rdquo; and head out for a two- or three-day
                            trip; and when he came back reenergized, we would
                            immediately continue from morning till night with
                            this two-person job of manuscript correction, which
                            truly wearied us to the core. It took us three full
                            months to repeat this process three times, going
                            through the entire manuscript from beginning to end,
                            letter by letter, phrase by phrase. Because I was
                            made to do this severe compulsory revision of an
                            extremely difficult English composition, so to
                            speak, for such a long time, I felt that, thanks to
                            this ordeal, I had somehow come to truly understand
                            for the first time the nature of English prose. Even
                            today, I feel grateful whenever I recall Harry
                            Laurence, now deceased, as one of the people who did
                            the most for me in my life.

                            After this rigorous thrice-repeated process of
                            rewriting and correction, we had this all reset in
                            type and at last came to feel that it was good
                            enough. Next, as a representative of cultured
                            society I had
                            <a
                              href="https://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/resource/?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fyashiro.itatti.harvard.edu%2Fresource%2Fyashiro%2Fperson%2Farthur_waley"
                              >Arthur Waley</a
                            >&mdash;who was famous among other things for his
                            English translation of
                            <em>The Tale of Genji</em> and particularly well
                            known as a stylist, and with whom I was on friendly
                            terms&mdash;read through the whole thing and mark
                            passages that felt to him clumsy or out of place.
                            Then Laurence and I, using the same process as
                            before, carefully addressed such passages; and once
                            that was finished, we then had an ordinary young
                            woman who worked in the office of the Medici Society
                            read through the entire thing as a representative of
                            the general readership and again mark passages that
                            were difficult to understand, tough to follow, and
                            so forth; and again we corrected these, and finally
                            decided that this would do. Although it was such an
                            ordeal during this period that I often wanted to
                            cry, I could not help but be also utterly impressed
                            by the conscientious approach of England&rsquo;s
                            publishers with their sense of responsibility.
                            Namely, through this sort of thorough care taken by
                            the editor-in-chief Laurence, the text of my book,
                            despite the fact that it was corrected to such an
                            extent, is entirely my own English prose. In its
                            logic as well as its sense of language, the text is
                            pervaded through and through by an individuality and
                            personal color that are my own as a person of the
                            East. Because of this, I can open the book to any
                            page even today and sense my own disposition in it.
                            For an author, there is no greater feeling of relief
                            and happiness than this.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In this way the rewriting and correction of the text
                            of my <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> was brought to a
                            satisfactory conclusion. Concurrently with this, we
                            finished all the organization, layout, and editing
                            of the color print comprising the frontispiece of
                            the first volume and the numerous photographs that
                            were to be used as illustrations in volumes two and
                            three. Both editor-in-chief Laurence and I were
                            absolutely exhausted. The publication preparations
                            were finished in their entirety in December, right
                            before Christmas. I was thirty-five years old at the
                            time. I took up my pen one last time and, with a
                            heartfelt earnestness, wrote my dedication to be
                            inserted at the beginning of the volume.
                          </p>

                            To<br />My Father<br />Who died waiting<br />And<br />My
                            Mother<br />Who waits
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            &nbsp;I literally boarded ship the next day and
                            returned to my hometown Yokohama, which had been
                            devastated by the earthquake, and to my mother, who
                            had grown weary waiting. The ship arrived in
                            Yokohama on a cold winter evening. My mother had
                            become a small old woman; she was crouched by the
                            harbor&rsquo;s quay, unable to stand. When she saw
                            me, all she said was &ldquo;oh, oh&rdquo; in
                            surprise.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            &nbsp;After that, nearly one year passed, and then
                            the first limited edition in three large volumes of
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> arrived in Japan. I felt
                            both happy and reserved at its handsomeness; its
                            list price was twenty-seven English guineas, selling
                            in Japan for three hundred yen. Since this was the
                            fourteenth year of Taishō [1925], this was an
                            exceedingly high price, and I heard something to the
                            effect that it sold no more than about thirty copies
                            in Japan. Although it often made the newspapers as a
                            big foreign dispatch, as far as I know not a single
                            review came out in Japan. There were just backbiting
                            whispers that Yashiro had apparently published a big
                            book abroad, as if publishing a big book were a
                            foolish thing to do&mdash;which made me feel both
                            isolated and annoyed. But since I trusted that this
                            was a book that ought to be judged abroad, I was
                            relatively unconcerned with the jealous silence of
                            the scholarly world in Japan, and I secretly thought
                            to myself, &ldquo;Just you wait!&rdquo;
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Once more, however, I made an unexpected
                            acquaintance in Japan. Mr. Fukai Eigo, then the vice
                            president of the Bank of Japan, was, I was told,
                            someone who was at that time constantly checking the
                            state of the foreign exchange, and he looked over a
                            large number of foreign newspapers and magazines.
                            Thereupon, due to the fact that articles and reviews
                            about me were appearing prominently in so many
                            different places, he asked the people around him
                            what sort of person Mr. Yashiro was and approached
                            me. After that, Mr. Fukai became the president of
                            the Bank of Japan, and ultimately became a member of
                            the Privy Council; and until he passed away, I was
                            always the recipient of his patronage and favor.
                            When the necessity arose for me to travel abroad to
                            respond to the reviews that had come out there, as
                            well as to publish the second edition of
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em>&mdash;the less expensive
                            so-called popular edition&mdash;it was Mr. Fukai
                            Eigo who spoke with Mr. Tsurumi Sakio, the director
                            of the Keimeikai Foundation, and secured funds for
                            my travel expenses. In later years, Mr. Yasui Sōtarō
                            painted Mr. Fukai&rsquo;s portrait, which became
                            exceedingly famous. This came about through my
                            above-mentioned relationship with Mr. Fukai: I
                            received a request from Mr. Fukai and recommended
                            Mr. Yasui, who had recently returned from abroad, as
                            a painter; and thus was that masterpiece born.

                            expensive edition in one volume, of my

                              ><em>Sandro Botticelli</em> </a
                            >was published.&nbsp;I inserted a long preface at
                            the beginning of the second edition in response to
                            the various foreign reviews of the book. In
                            particular, I had taken offense at the long review
                            by the famous senior member of the world of
                            criticism in Britain, Roger Fry, who had to a
                            certain extent written in the vein of &ldquo;What a
                            cheeky young Asian!&rdquo; Furthermore, I felt that
                            he would be a capable opponent, and so I bravely
                            fought back. There was a bit of a reason for this. I
                            have already mentioned the distinguished Herbert
                            Horne, who was an extremely studious British
                            Botticelli scholar. I deeply respected Horne&rsquo;s
                            writing, and had studied his book more carefully
                            than anybody. That being said, as the result of such
                            study I came to hold my own ideas about
                            Botticelli&rsquo;s works, and it was often
                            inevitable that I reached a conclusion different
                            from Horne&rsquo;s. This was exactly the same as
                            how, no matter how much I might respect and look up
                            to Mr. Berenson, I am not necessarily beholden to
                            each and every one of his conclusions. Such is the
                            nature of the fine arts. I got the sense, however,
                            that Roger Fry&mdash;who had been a close friend of
                            Herbert Horne while he was alive&mdash;ultimately
                            criticized me because he harbored a fundamental
                            antipathy to the effect that it was insolent of me
                            to advocate, in spite of the fact that I was just
                            some young person from the East, a differing opinion
                            with regard to Herbert Horne, who was such a
                            prominent authority in the field. In which case, I,
                            too, could not very well remain silent. Meanwhile,
                            the long review article of my new
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> published in the opening
                            pages of the

                            >, the literary weekly of <em>The London Times</em>,
                            was unsigned by the author due to the fact that it
                            was an editorial. Since reviews of new publications
                            in <em>The London Times</em> are given the most
                            weight, however, it was a given that an authority in
                            the field would be entrusted with writing it; but it
                            was unfortunate that I had no idea who the author of
                            that long article was. And although there was also
                            no one who informed me who the author was, at any
                            rate the review grasped well indeed what I had
                            intended to say and furthermore gave me high praise,
                            so I felt extremely satisfied. Various other reviews
                            were also published here and there; among these, it
                            was an honor to have Mr. Eric Maclagan, a major
                            figure in the field of medieval and Renaissance
                            studies in England and at the time the director of
                            the Victoria and Albert Museum, write an exceedingly
                            kind review. At any rate, it seemed ultimately that
                            opinions on the value of my book were settled in
                            England when the editorial review in
                            <em>The London Times</em> came out. A representative
                            review in America was the long essay that Royal
                            Cortissoz, who was a famous critic in those days,
                            wrote praising me highly in
                            <em>Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine</em>. And when the
                            second edition, namely the less expensive edition in
                            one volume, was in this way eventually published,
                            Harvard University, in cooperation with the Carnegie
                            Foundation in America, invited me as a lecturer in
                            their main faculty. Circumstances in Japan did not
                            allow me to accept the two-year invitation, and so I
                            went and lectured for half a year, namely for one
                            semester only. It is a strange coincidence that one
                            of the students who attended my class lectures was
                            [Edwin] Reischauer, the former U.S. Ambassador to
                            Japan. And after the war I received, in addition to
                            a decoration, the Italian Order of Merit for Culture
                            and Art (Gold Class) from the Italian government for
                            my achievements in service to Italian art.

                            Thus, the publication of my book on Botticelli had
                            an extremely broad range of influence
                            abroad&mdash;the opposite of its cool reception in
                            Japan&mdash;and indeed seemed to preordain the
                            course of my life thenceforth. For example,
                            immediately after the publication of the first
                            edition, a woman whom I had never met and who
                            apparently was a German scholar came to me saying
                            that she wanted to publish a German translation of
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em>. This was, for me, a
                            felicitous proposal, and I was of the mind to give
                            my consent; but when I discussed the matter with the
                            Medici Society they did not agree, saying that,
                            although this is at the discretion of the author,
                            from the standpoint of the Medici Society this was a
                            high-quality book published at an exceptional
                            expense, and furthermore English is understood by
                            educated people across Europe, and the book has also
                            been selling quite well in Germany&mdash;and so
                            accordingly they would prefer me, to the extent
                            possible, to refrain from obliging. In which case I
                            respected the wishes of the Medici Society&mdash;on
                            whom I had imposed to such an extreme
                            degree&mdash;and resolved to not put out
                            translations into other languages. And although I am
                            often asked about not putting out a

                            and I thought that, as per &ldquo;the prose belies
                            the person,&rdquo; it would surely be the case that
                            I myself would not be pleased were someone else to
                            do it for me, and so I turned down all requests for
                            translation.

                            There were also things like this. I had been
                            thinking for some while that, once my Botticelli
                            research was finished for the time being, next I
                            would like to create a coherent whole out of my
                            research on Leonardo da Vinci, an even bigger figure
                            than Botticelli. Moreover, the publisher of my
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em>, the Medici Society, said
                            that they would gladly publish my study of Leonardo
                            on the occasion of its completion, whereupon my own
                            enthusiasm for the project grew, and when I went to
                            London to put out the second, less expensive edition
                            as described above, I took advantage of the
                            opportunity to gain special permission from the
                            British Royal Household and research the extensive
                            collection of sketches by Leonardo held in the Royal
                            Library at Windsor Castle. One day during this
                            period, I was invited to a dinner by the London PEN
                            Club. Since this was more than thirty years before a
                            PEN Club was established in Japan, I had no idea at
                            all what this so-called PEN Club was. I was at that
                            time engrossed in my Leonardo research and had
                            hidden myself away in the country town of Windsor,
                            and I had no friends nearby to explain to me what
                            the PEN Club was. Furthermore, it was clearly
                            specified that attendants at the dinner should wear
                            a tailcoat, and needless to say I did not have a
                            tailcoat and so forth on hand. And so I felt it to
                            be a foolishly fussy dinner party, and it grew to be
                            too much of a bother. I sent in a notice that I
                            would not attend. When I spoke about this matter
                            after the fact with Laurence, the editor-in-chief of
                            the Medici Society, he was in turn flabbergasted and
                            angry: &ldquo;What a foolish thing you&rsquo;ve
                            done! Oh, well.&rdquo; He went on to tell me things
                            like, &ldquo;It is a great honor for a writer to be
                            formally invited to a dinner by the PEN Club, and it
                            also has a large impact on the sales of one&rsquo;s
                            book. I would have lent you a tailcoat and so
                            forth&mdash;oh, well.&rdquo;

                          <p>
                            Likewise, in the case of my becoming friends with
                            the Rockefeller family in America, too, my book
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> acted as intermediary.
                            The mother of John D. Rockefeller III, who built the
                            International House of Japan in Tokyo&mdash;in other
                            words, the wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr.&mdash;was
                            an exceptional enthusiast of the fine arts, and had
                            purchased a lovely small-scale painting called
                            <em
                              >Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John the
                              Baptist</em
                            >, which I included in my
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> and which was previously
                            held in London. Right at the time when I was at
                            Harvard University as an invited lecturer, the
                            faculty meeting of the department of Fine Arts was
                            held at the primary Rockefeller residence, which was
                            near what is nowadays the Museum of Modern Art in
                            New York. Even I, a lecturer, was asked to attend,
                            and so I headed out with the other professors. After
                            our luncheon, Mrs. Rockefeller said to me,
                            &ldquo;There is something that I would especially
                            like to show you,&rdquo; and I was taken to a
                            different room, where the newly purchased
                            <em
                              >Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John the
                              Baptist</em
                            >
                            by Botticelli was hanging on the wall. &ldquo;When I
                            learned that you would be coming to my home today, I
                            thought I would like to give you a surprise by
                            showing this to you,&rdquo; she said. This marked
                            the start of our relationship, and I came to call on
                            the Rockefeller residence from time to time. Because
                            Mrs. Rockefeller also loved modern painting greatly,
                            one of the floors of her multistoried residence
                            functioned as a small gallery, and it was here that
                            I was shown for the first time, among other things,
                            small pieces by Diego Rivera, the up-and-coming
                            Mexican painter whom Mrs. Rockefeller favored at the
                            time. And, in addition to the above, I was
                            astonished indeed to see that the other rooms of the
                            residence were filled with a collection of
                            extraordinarily valuable masterpieces: a large,
                            magnificent torso of Tang marble, which is famous in
                            Chinese sculpture; a Six Dynasties pair of two large
                            gilt-bronze Buddhist statues with beautiful gold
                            plating; a dazzling Gothic tapestry from
                            Europe&rsquo;s Middle Ages of the highest quality;
                            and so forth.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            And I first became acquainted with the former
                            Italian Ambassador to Japan,

                            Hotel in San Francisco as he was on his way to his
                            first appointment in Japan and as I was returning
                            home from lecturing at Harvard University.
                            &ldquo;Although I am heading to Japan after this on

                            told me, and afterward, while chatting about various
                            matters, he suddenly asked me the following:
                            &ldquo;There is a Japanese who has written a
                            splendid book on the Italian painter Botticelli. I
                            read the book with pleasure, and am looking forward
                            to meeting the author when I go to Japan. Would you
                            happen to know the author, by any chance?&rdquo; I
                            was taken aback by the question and answered,
                            &ldquo;Actually, that person would be me.&rdquo;
                            This was the beginning of a lifelong friendship
                            between the two of us.

                            When I went to America for the first time after the
                            war, I was thoroughly surprised by the large-scale,
                            superior, massive collection of artwork at the
                            National Gallery of Art in Washington, and by the
                            splendor of its architecture. As a collection of
                            Western painting, it had in a single bound entered
                            the top class of such collections around the world,

                            display. One of these, a large work entitled
                            <em>The Adoration of the Magi</em>, was previously
                            held in the Winter Palace&mdash;the former royal
                            residence&mdash;and the Hermitage Museum of
                            Leningrad in the Soviet Union. Before the
                            publication of my book
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em>&mdash;that is, when the
                            Soviet Union had not yet gained a sense of
                            stability&mdash;I once endured a good deal of
                            difficulty in entering the Soviet Union to make my
                            way purposely to Leningrad via Finland to research
                            this painting by Botticelli. It was thus an
                            important work, and a masterpiece of which I had
                            strong memories. Mr. [Andrew] Mellon, the man of
                            wealth from Pittsburgh who had once served as the
                            U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and who had also
                            served as the Ambassador to the Soviet Union,
                            purchased the Botticelli painting from the Soviet
                            Union along with a variety of other famous
                            paintings, and it was one of the masterpieces he
                            gave to the National Gallery. Seeing as how the
                            National Gallery held a number of Botticelli-related
                            paintings in addition to this one, ever since my
                            first visit there I had a particularly close
                            relationship with director John Walker, who was my
                            junior as a pupil of Mr. Berenson, having studied
                            under him for many years in Italy; whenever I
                            visited the museum, I would be asked of my opinion
                            on the Botticelli paintings in the museum&rsquo;s
                            collection and on works of that school, and was
                            often also asked to give lectures on topics like
                            &ldquo;the art of Botticelli&rdquo; and
                            &ldquo;Italian painting.&rdquo; And once, when I was
                            given a large book of paintings called

                            famous paintings in the museum&rsquo;s collection,

                            was a portrait of a fine youth; in the picture the
                            youth was depicted holding a beautiful hand, which
                            gave the impression of an exceedingly nervous
                            temperament, to his chest. And selected and printed

                            Botticelli treated what could be called the beauty
                            of the human hand with the utmost sensitivity; and I
                            was also introduced as the author of
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em>. Until that moment I had
                            not been informed that such a book of paintings had
                            been published, and when I discovered that a passage
                            from my <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> had been
                            excerpted in the company of other selections from
                            well-regarded works on the fine arts, I felt a
                            little embarrassed, but also extremely honored.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            At a later date, I heard from someone who visited
                            this National Gallery in Washington that the museum
                            has a so-called audio guide: while you are looking
                            at the paintings on display in the museum, if you
                            pay a fee they will lend you a small device that you
                            wear on your ears, and, while wearing it, you can
                            listen to a broadcast of explanations pertinent to
                            the paintings on display. And this person told me,
                            &ldquo;When I was listening in front of a Botticelli
                            painting, your name came up!&rdquo; This, too, was
                            for me a piece of unexpected news.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            At any rate, I often traveled abroad thereafter,
                            too, for such things as requests to give a lecture
                            at a university or a talk at an art museum; and I
                            saw firsthand that, generally speaking, either the
                            first large-volume edition of my
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> in three volumes or at
                            the very least the second edition in a single volume
                            was without fail among the holdings of art museums,
                            university libraries, and art historical research
                            institutes in various countries, and that copies of
                            the large first edition in particular had been worn
                            by frequent handling, or were dirty, or had had
                            their binding repaired. This made me happier than
                            anything, as it was evidence that my book was
                            actually still relevant and in use as a text. And
                            the fact that my book was almost certainly included
                            in bibliographies of Western art history and
                            Renaissance art also gave me great satisfaction.
                            This all served as the best possible consolation for
                            me with regards to the loneliness I felt due to the
                            mean-spirited silence and backbiting in my native
                            country, and was also an international critical
                            opinion that established proof of the way things
                            really were.

                            After the publication of my
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em>, my encounters with
                            unexpected admirers of my book here and there, while
                            traveling in various countries, were also a happy
                            occurrence for an author like myself. Someone like
                            the wealthy Mrs. [Anna Rice] Cooke of Honolulu,
                            Hawaii was one of the most unexpectedly enthusiastic
                            of such individuals.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            &nbsp;The Cooke family and the Spalding family, into
                            which Mrs. Cooke&rsquo;s daughter had married, were
                            distinguished Hawaiian families of the first rank,
                            and especially the elderly Mrs. Cooke was an
                            enthusiast of the fine arts, who personally
                            established and in addition managed the splendid
                            Honolulu Academy of Arts and its attached school for
                            the fine arts. This Honolulu Academy of Arts,
                            although one cannot say it is a particularly large
                            museum in size, would be an impressive museum with a
                            rich array of content even if one were to today pick
                            it up and move it to the U.S. mainland. The founder
                            of this museum, Mrs. Cooke, believed Hawaii to be
                            perfectly suited as a central site where the two
                            worlds of East and West meet; the museum&mdash;which
                            was a beautiful one-story building in the Spanish
                            style seen in California, built to seem sunken among
                            the shade of green leaves&mdash;was designed to have
                            a clear-cut symmetrical plan, divided such that one
                            half comprised the section of Western art and the
                            other half comprised the section of Eastern art,
                            with works of considerable distinction exhibited in
                            each. The construction of this building was finished
                            in 1929, and, in the present day more than forty
                            years later, this museum&rsquo;s Eastern art section
                            continues to develop more and more in conjunction
                            with the increased global popularity of research on
                            Asia. At any rate, when I passed through Hawaii
                            immediately after the construction of this museum, I
                            received an invitation from Mrs. Cooke and visited
                            her large residence up on a mountain above Honolulu,
                            which commanded a superb view of the mountains and
                            the ocean. At our first meeting, Mrs. Cooke
                            unexpectedly brought out the three-volume first
                            edition of my <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> and told
                            me, &ldquo;I love Botticelli&rsquo;s art, and so I
                            have been enjoying reading this book of
                            yours,&rdquo; and then had me sign her copy. She was
                            truly a kind and courteous old woman, and I was
                            supremely happy to know that my book had found favor
                            with such a fine individual. And above all it was
                            for me an exceedingly pleasant discovery to learn
                            that the place in question was, contrary to
                            expectations, a small, isolated, far-off island on
                            the Pacific Ocean. From that time onward, I came to
                            be on friendly terms with the Honolulu Academy of
                            Arts, and en route to and from America I would
                            frequently stop by Hawaii, having been asked to give
                            a lecture or something of that nature. Above all,
                            about ten years ago I spent a few days in Honolulu
                            for the first time in a while on the way to
                            California&rsquo;s Stanford University on invitation
                            with my wife. Thereupon I thought that I would like
                            to visit not only the Honolulu Academy of the Arts
                            but also the mountaintop residence of its founder,
                            Mrs. Cooke&mdash;it would be the first time in a
                            long time&mdash;and that I would also like to show
                            the residence to my wife, as well. When we had
                            someone take us up to this mountaintop residence, I
                            found that Mrs. Cooke had already passed away a long
                            time ago; Mrs. Cooke&rsquo;s daughter Mrs. Spalding
                            was living there, and she came out and received us
                            with a smile, having become a stout, gentle old
                            woman in the spitting image of her deceased mother.
                            From this I got the feeling that this was a direct
                            continuation of the time that I first visited the
                            residence forty years ago, and I could not bear the
                            bittersweet feeling of nostalgia. Eventually Mrs.
                            Spalding stood up as if she had suddenly remembered
                            something, said, &ldquo;Please wait a moment,&rdquo;
                            and went into the next room. When before long she
                            returned to where we were, she was carrying a large
                            and apparently heavy book. In other words she had,
                            just for us, brought out the family copy of the
                            three-volume first edition of my
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em>. I was struck by her
                            kindness, and when I opened the first volume for the
                            first time after so many years, my signature was
                            there at the front of the book. Since the date was
                            signed as 1929, I remembered that in other words my
                            first visit to this residence took place in the year
                            in which the Academy opened. Thereupon Mrs. Spalding
                            put the same volume in front of us, and I was
                            utterly surprised when, in an unhurried voice, she
                            recited from memory the opening paragraph of the
                            preface to my book.

                              >This is a book of Art. Its appeal is to the human
                              heart. In the appreciation of Art there is no such
                              thing as authority. Scholarship adorns, even
                              dignifies criticism, but does not authorize it. A
                              critic should not pose as a judge: he is a friend.
                              My wish is to deliver Art from the guidance of
                              specialists and return it to the simple desire of
                              man. </em

                              I have written down my joy that others may share
                              it, or rather that others may open their eyes and
                              get greater delight from Art in their own way. I
                              long to see my book reach congenial hearts that
                              love beauty, rather than brains of pure
                              scholarship.</em

                            And Mrs. Spalding said to me, &ldquo;My mother was
                            exceptionally fond of the beginning part of the
                            preface of this book, and thought that anything
                            other than such an attitude was impermissible for
                            teaching about the fine arts. She excerpted this
                            opening passage, had it printed, and had the people
                            at the Academy&rsquo;s attached school for the fine
                            arts read it like a textbook. Thereby I, too,
                            unintentionally became able to recite it by memory,
                            which I can still do to this day.&rdquo; I do not
                            remember when, but I once heard a rumor that Mrs.
                            Cooke had taken an excerpt from my
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em> and was using it like a
                            textbook at the art school. But both my wife and I
                            were deeply moved by the fact that Mrs.
                            Cooke&rsquo;s daughter recited the passage by memory
                            for us that day, forty years after the fact.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I was utterly taken aback with surprise at the fact
                            that on a far-off, isolated island like Hawaii there
                            was a family of such devoted readers of my
                            <em>Sandro Botticelli</em>, and could not help but
                            think that they probably deserved to be called the
                            number-one fans of my book. As an author, there is
                            nothing as delightful as this.
